/**
 * Subclasses of unescaped_pcdata_element must contain only string children.
 * However, the strings will not be escaped. This is intended for tags like
 * <script> or <style> whose content is interpreted literally by the browser.
 *
 * From section 6.2 of the HTML 4.01 spec: "Although the STYLE and SCRIPT
 * elements use CDATA for their data model, for these elements, CDATA must be
 * handled differently by user agents. Markup and entities must be treated as
 * raw text and passed to the application as is. The first occurrence of the
 * character sequence "</" (end-tag open delimiter) is treated as terminating
 * the end of the s content. In valid documents, this would be the end tag for
 * the element."
